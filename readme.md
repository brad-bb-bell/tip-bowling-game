# The rules listed here operate just as a game of bowling would.
# Solve one problem at a time, in order.
# Make sure to re-run any previously solved examples.
  # Sometimes code changes that work towards the current example will break a prior one
# In general, you should solve each problem using whatever means necessary to get working code.
  # At some point you may cross a bridge where your logic is quite tangled.
  # Empower yourself to refactor towards an understandable solution, or think about new ways to approach scoring a bowling game.

# A simple game, with no particularly interesting throws. Every throw is recorded
# by the number of pins knocked down.
# Score: 63

# New rule: extra frames. If you get a strike or a spare in frame 10, we need additional
# throws to figure out how much to score. In this case we got a strike, so we take two
# additional throws (5 and 4) which are added to our frame 10 score. They are _not_ added
# to the total score themselves, they exist only to score frame 10.
